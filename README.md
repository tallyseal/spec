# CRAWCUS

**Contract · Receipt · Attestation · Warrant** — an open specification for cryptographic audit receipts covering both application transactions and AI-inference decisions under one canonical shape.

## Why this exists

When a regulator, auditor, or plaintiff asks *"prove this record has not been altered since it was written,"* the honest answer available today is usually one of:

- *"Trust our vendor's audit log."* Useless when the vendor is a defendant.
- *"Run our proprietary tool."* A black box the regulator cannot independently verify.
- *"Here are our SIEM logs."* Unsigned and mutable by anyone with SIEM admin.
- *"We put hashes on a blockchain."* GDPR-incompatible at enterprise write throughput.

CRAWCUS makes a fourth answer possible: **replay the receipt chain against any conformant verifier and prove integrity mathematically, not by trusting a vendor.**

## What CRAWCUS is

Every CRAWCUS receipt is a small structured JSON document, canonicalised per [RFC 8785 (JCS)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785), hashed with SHA-256, and appended to a hash-chained log where each entry references the hash of the previous one. Tampering with any historical record breaks the chain in a way any auditor can verify with an open-source tool in seconds.

The specification is deliberately not proprietary. Any party — systems integrator, adjacent vendor, individual developer, regulator — can implement a conformant runtime or verifier. A receipt standard that only one vendor can verify is not useful for compliance.

CRAWCUS composes existing open standards ([RFC 8785 JCS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785), [SHA-256 FIPS 180-4](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final), [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339), [DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse), [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev), the erasable-immutable-log pattern for GDPR). The value it adds is the *shape* — a specific set of fields, their meanings, and two-scope coverage of both application transactions and AI-inference decisions under one canonical form. The cryptographic primitives underneath are unchanged.

## Conformance tiers

Ratified 2026-09-01: CRAWCUS ships as a two-tier spec so implementers can pick the level that matches their integration surface.

| Tier | Primitives | Sufficient for | Reference impl |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CRAWCUS-Core-1.0** | Contract · Receipt · Attestation · Warrant (4) | Hash-chained audit interop, CloudEvents / JWT / SD-JWT payload embedding, federated-learning per-node receipts, most application-level audit trails | [`clients/flower/`](clients/flower/) — Python client for the Flower federated-learning framework |
| **CRAWCUS-Extended-1.0** | Core + Disclosure · Consent · Lineage · HumanOversight · Tool-use (9) | AACI-shape regulator compliance: GDPR Art. 22 automated-decision-making, EU AI Act Art. 14 / Art. 50 human-oversight + deepfake-disclosure, FERPA §99.31 disclosure-consent | [`packages/regulations-gdpr`](packages/regulations-gdpr/), [`packages/regulations-ferpa`](packages/regulations-ferpa/), [`packages/regulations-eu-ai-act`](packages/regulations-eu-ai-act/) |

Implementers declare their conformance tier in package metadata (`package.json` `crawcus.conformance`; `pyproject.toml` `[tool.crawcus] conformance`).

Full details: [`docs/canon/architecture-primitives.md`](docs/canon/architecture-primitives.md).

## Who this is for

| If you are a… | You care about |
|---|---|
| **Regulator or auditor** | Verifying a customer's receipt chain independently, without their cooperation and without trusting the vendor that produced it. Start with [`packages/verifier`](packages/verifier/) and the TCK. |
| **Compliance lead** (CISO, GRC, DPO, model-risk officer) | Answering procurement questionnaires and regulator letters with *"here is the open spec our system emits; you can verify without us."* Anti-lock-in, anti-vendor-defendant. Start with [`docs/spec/chain-of-custody-envelope.md`](docs/spec/chain-of-custody-envelope.md). |
| **Enterprise CTO or architect** | Evaluating whether a CRAWCUS-emitting product satisfies walk-away, forensic-replay, and cross-runtime-audit requirements. Read the spec + verify a real chain end-to-end. |
| **Engineer building a conformant runtime** | Producing receipts that pass the TCK and consuming receipts from any other conformant runtime. Start with [`packages/spec`](packages/spec/) + [`packages/tck`](packages/tck/). |
| **Author of an adjacent open-source project** (federated learning, model serving, LLM observability, MLOps) | Adding a small reference client so users get per-decision signed receipts. See [`clients/flower/`](clients/flower/) as the pattern. |
| **Standards-body reviewer** (LF AI & Data / JDF) | Assessing scope, governance trajectory, licensing, prior-art composition. Start with [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) + [`docs/spec/`](docs/spec/). |

## Quick start

### Verify a receipt chain

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @crawcus/verifier build

# Verify a chain from a JSONL file
node packages/verifier/dist/cli.js verify chain.jsonl
```

### Emit receipts from a Python Flower client

```bash
pip install crawcus-flower

# See clients/flower/examples/quickstart.py for the full walkthrough.
```

### Build a conformant runtime in another language

1. Read [`docs/spec/crawcus-format.md`](docs/spec/crawcus-format.md) — wire format
2. Read [`docs/spec/crawcus-contracts.md`](docs/spec/crawcus-contracts.md) — Contract primitive
3. Implement the primitives your target tier requires (Core or Extended per [`docs/canon/architecture-primitives.md`](docs/canon/architecture-primitives.md))
4. Run the [`@crawcus/tck`](packages/tck/) fixture set against your implementation
5. Publish with a conformance-tier declaration in the README

Any language with JCS + SHA-256 + optional signing (`Ed25519` / DSSE / Sigstore) can produce conformant receipts.

## Standards CRAWCUS builds on

CRAWCUS does not reinvent cryptographic primitives. It composes:

| Primitive | Standard |
|---|---|
| JSON canonical serialization | [RFC 8785 JCS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785) |
| Chain-link hash | [FIPS 180-4 SHA-256](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final) |
| Timestamps | [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) (subset of ISO 8601) |
| Optional signature envelope | [DSSE](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse) |
| Optional supply-chain signing | [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev) |
| Erasable-immutable log pattern | GDPR crypto-shred + tombstone (see [`docs/spec/crawcus-format.md`](docs/spec/crawcus-format.md) §GDPR erasure) |
| Actor-attribution conventions | [OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749), mTLS, SAML — no CRAWCUS-specific extension |

## Governance + standards-body path

CRAWCUS is authored openly under the governance model in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md). During the current pre-donation phase the project has a single maintainer (Paul Wander); the model transitions to a multi-maintainer / TSC structure at Linux Foundation donation.

The intended donation target is the **Linux Foundation AI & Data** foundation, submitted via the **Joint Development Foundation (JDF)** — the same track [C2PA](https://c2pa.org), [in-toto](https://in-toto.io), and [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev) took. Progress is public in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/tallyseal/crawcus/discussions) (once the repository goes live).

Rationale for LF over W3C / IEEE / ISO: 6–12 month realistic timeline to a recognised standard, industry-neutral governance from day one, no PAR ceremony blocking spec publication, alignment with existing peer projects in the receipt / supply-chain-signing space.

## Openness — what we claim, what we do not

We are careful with claims. A receipt standard is only as trustworthy as the honesty of its openness claims.

**What is true today:**

- The spec is published and free to implement (CC-BY-4.0).
- Reference implementations are shipped as open source (Apache-2.0).
- Every runtime — including the reference implementations here — is measured against the same TCK fixture set.
- Anyone can verify a chain independently of any vendor.

**What is not yet true:**

- Multi-vendor implementation ecosystem — the reference implementations in this repository are the initial implementations. Third-party conformant implementations are actively encouraged.
- LF / JDF adoption — submission in flight, not accepted.
- Widespread production deployment — early adopters welcome.

Where we describe CRAWCUS externally we use plain language matching the current state, not aspirational marketing. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) §"Language + claims" for the discipline maintainers apply.

## Verify this release

Every `@crawcus/*` npm package and `crawcus-*` PyPI package published from this repository is signed via [Trusted Publishers](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) (OIDC — no long-lived API tokens) with [Sigstore attestations](https://docs.sigstore.dev) bound to the specific source commit + GitHub Actions workflow run. Publishing an audit-integrity library without cryptographic supply-chain proof would be self-parodying.

Each release includes the exact `sigstore verify` command in its release notes. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) §"Supply-chain integrity guarantees" for the full commitment.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome from anyone building or evaluating cryptographic audit systems. Start at [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Three contribution tracks, each with its own flow:

- **Spec changes** — ADR-shaped GitHub Discussion first (14-day comment window), then PR
- **Reference-implementation changes** — standard PR flow with tests + TCK conformance + DCO sign-off
- **Documentation** — direct PR for typos and clarifications; open a Discussion first for substantive rewrites

Every commit must be [DCO](https://developercertificate.org)-signed (`git commit -s`). No CLA required. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full flow, PR checklist, and quality gates.
